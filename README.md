# Uncanny Valley EEE

This is the source code for the data analysis performed in the [Investigating the Uncanny Valley Phenomenon Through the Temporal Dynamics of Neural Responses to Virtual Characters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16233) published in the proceedings of the [2023 IEEE Conference on Games](https://2023.ieee-cog.org/).

The data collected and analysed in the article is available on Zenodo at [https://www.zenodo.org/record/7948158](https://www.zenodo.org/record/7948158). 
To execute the code in the repository it is first necessary to download the [Raw.zip](https://www.zenodo.org/record/7948158/files/Raw.zip?download=1) and [Scratch.zip](https://www.zenodo.org/record/7948158/files/Scratch.zip?download=1) files and decompress the content in the code root folder as the scripts expect the data to be contained in the Raw and Scratch folders.
